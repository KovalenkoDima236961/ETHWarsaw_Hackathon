1) The problem is that it takes too long to sign in the second time.
2) Next, I need to think about the accessKey (using @civic/auth-verify or the SDK)
3) Provide authorization for pages.
4) Create minting pages.
5) Write a zkProof for verifying the name in the certificate with your name.
6) Write AllCertificatePage.
7) Write the docker-compose file.
8) As a future wokr, I will add the merkle tree, if I have the time

The last thing is the docs: Auth-MCP / npm @civic/auth-mcp to add authentication and user context to your existing MCP server. This gets you extra credit!
